## üìê Project logos

- A good source for logos is their Wikipedia page. SVG is preferred as the file size is usually smaller and it scales.
- SVG images can be compressed using the also lossless scour using the command line: `scour -i filename.svg -o filename-compressed.svg --create-groups --enable-id-stripping --enable-comment-stripping --shorten-ids --remove-metadata --strip-xml-prolog --no-line-breaks;`
